# **Challenge Preface, Takeaways**

In [Malicious PowerShell Analysis](https://blueteamlabs.online/home/challenge/7) a malicious PowerShell script that was executed from an email attachment is provided for analysis. As an incident responder, decode the PowerShell script and identify the type of malware responsible.

Both public services and enterprise companies have access to email filtering services. Email content and attachments can be reviewed and compared to known malicious indicators before the email arrives in an inbox. Additionally, email can be assigned as spam by configured filtering rules so that caution is advised. If a file appears suspicious, it can be analyzed by [VirusTotal](https://www.virustotal.com/gui/) for malicious indicators.
