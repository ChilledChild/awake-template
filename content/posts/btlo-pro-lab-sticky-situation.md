# **Preface, Takeaways**

In [Sticky Situation](https://blueteamlabs.online/home/investigation/3), a highly confidential document has been stolen from Prime Minister’s laptop and has been sold in the Dark Web. Using Autopsy and other available digital forensic tools, determine the document was obtained and identify the USB drive used by the malicious actor.

Physical security is just as important as technical security. A network may be secured, though physical access to a device introduces new attack vectors to account for. Ensuring that data is encrypted at rest, access is granted after a successful logon, and implementing other factors of authentication such as a security key make the malicious actor's work much more difficult.
